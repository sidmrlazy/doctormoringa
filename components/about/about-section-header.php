            <p class="text-justify">Doctor Moringa deeply believes in the ‘Goodness of the Miracle Tree’ . We work with
                thousands of small
                family farmers in India to cultivate tens of thousands of acres of sustainable organic farmland.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Doctor Moringa products support holistic wellness and are made with only ‘Pure’
                ingredients. Each product
                is one link in a chain of connectedness between Mother Nature, our farmers and you. By choosing Doctor
                Moringa you are completing this chain, actively participating in our mission to create a sustainable
                environment of True Holistic Wellness, providing training and a life of dignity to our farmers and
                bringing health and happiness to you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">All of our farmers and tribal wildcrafters are educated in organic and biodynamic
                agricultural practices.
                We pay all the fees associated with acquiring the necessary organic certifications for them and then we
                purchase the harvested crops and herbs at a premium market price. </p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="text-justify">The farmers also rotate between growing crops on their land for us with food crops for
        themselves. This
        means farming families are supported by a sustainable income, while at the same time improving and
        preserving their own health and natural environment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Doctor Moringa is committed to being a trustworthy and innovative global leader by providing
        genuine True
        Holistic Wellness products. Our advanced processing methods and dehydration technologies ensure that our
        herbs retain their maximum level of potency for the highest quality, most effective, pure and natural
        products available in the market today. </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Our success serves as living proof that shared abundance can be created with an
        uncompromising commitment
        to environmental and social responsibility. In living this vision, we are inspired to introduce a new
        standard for new paradigm companies.</p>
