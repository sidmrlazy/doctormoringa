            <p class="faded-text">The potent combination of phytonutrients, amino acids, antibacterial compounds, and
                antioxidants that
                come
                together in Moringa form an excellent immune booster. Interestingly, researchers have found that even a
                low
                dose of moringa causes an increase in serum immunoglobulins, which are antibodies used by the immune
                system
                to attack viruses and bacteria. This occurs even at a cellular level and was found to work best at lower
                doses than at higher doses.

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa May reduce inflammation</p>
            <p class="faded-text">Moringa also contains a rare combination of Phytonutrients (36 to be exact), including
                kaempferol, quercetin, zeatin, beta-sitosterol, and caffeoylquinic acid, that have been known to have
                strong anti-inflammatory effects. Because of this, studies have determined that supplementing with
                Moringa may indeed be a useful treatment
                for acute inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, with one study in particular showing that Moringa
                was as promising as the potent drug indomethacin at improving inflammatory markers.

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa has Anti- Diabetic properties</p>
            <p class="faded-text">Moringa leaves have Quercetin which is an antioxidant that helps to lower blood
                pressure and another
                antioxidant is Chlorogenic acid which stabilizes blood sugar levels. The Chlorogenic acid found in
                moringa may help the body process sugar better and affect insulin too. In the powdered form, moringa has
                been found effective in reducing lipid and glucose levels, regulating oxidative stress and reducing
                blood sugar.</p>

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa improves Digestive problems</p>
            <p class="faded-text">It turns out that the anti-inflammatory flavonoids and antioxidants in Moringa also
                help to improve
                inflammatory digestive issues, such as constipation, gastritis, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel
                syndrome. The antibiotic and antibacterial properties of Moringa may help inhibit the growth of various
                pathogens, and its high vitamin B content helps with digestion. Researchers have found that moderate
                doses reduced mucosal inflammation severity, ulcer severity, and the
                weight of distal colon, which is a marker for inflammation and edema.</p>

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa has Antibacterial & Antifungal properties</p>
            <p class="faded-text">Moringa comes to the rescue once again in the fight against bacterial, fungal, and
                other infections. In
                fact, even potent bacteria such as staph have been shown to be hindered by Moringa extract. Due to its
                antibacterial, antifungal, and antimicrobial properties, moringa extracts might combat
                infections caused by Salmonella, Rhizopus, and E. coli. Studies credit Moringa’s blend of saponine,
                tannic, phenolic and alkaloid phytoconstituents for its
                antibacterial activities. Saponins especially have been studied for their ability to act as
                antibacterial and antifungal ‘detergents’ in the body. However, these effects occur not only in the
                body, but also in water. Researchers were surprised to
                discover that moringa seeds also purify water more efficiently than many popular synthetic materials!

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa stabilizes Mood, helps with depression and anxiety</p>
            <p class="faded-text">Moringa’s high protein content also makes it a great mood stabilizer. Specifically, it
                is rich in the
                amino acid tryptophan, which converts to mood-boosting serotonin in the body. Moringa is also used as an
                antidepressant in developing countries such as India. In the ancient system of
                Ayurveda, it is also used to enhance memory and treat nervous system disorders. People with depression
                also often experience anxiety, so a supplement that improves both is a win-win.
                Moringa oleifera to the rescue! There are a couple of different studies that have shown Moringa oleifera
                has a possible antianxiety effect. What’s especially interesting is that Moringa appears to have a
                variety of different mechanisms. This means it can most likely improve anxiety stemming from multiple
                sources. Moringa is also known as a superfood, so there are other ways its consumption can help decrease
                anxiety
                and encourage more relaxation. For example, Moringa contains tryptophan, which is known to relax the
                body and help it create serotonin

            <p class="homepage-grid-card-heading">Moringa fights Aging</p>
            <p class="faded-text">Moringa’s antioxidant content is truly exceptional. It’s rich in vitamin C,
                carotenoids, and polyphenols, which are stellar anti-aging compounds that help fight free radical damage
                and oxidative stress.
                One study showed that women supplementing with just 1½ teaspoons of moringa powder per day for three
                months ‘significantly increased’ their antioxidant levels while also decreasing their serum glucose
                levels.

            <p class="faded-text">In addition to its bountiful antioxidants, moringa is also a rich source of protein,
