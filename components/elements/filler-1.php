            <p>What is Moringa used for?</p>
            <h3>Moringa Oleifera is extremely nutritious and is a fairly large tree native to North India. It goes by a
                variety
                of names, such as drumstick tree, horseradish tree or ben oil tree.
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-3">The leaves, pods and seeds of the Moringa Tree are rich in antioxidants, amino acids,
                vitamins, and
                minerals.
                A
                complete protein, Moringa leaf powder contains all nine essential amino acids the body needs. The pods
                are a
                rich source of vitamin C and the edible seeds contain a high amount of oleic acidâ€”a beneficial fatty
                acid
                also
                found in olive oil.

            <p>The pods are exceptionally rich in vitamin C. One cup of fresh, sliced pods (100 grams) contains 157% of

            <p>Moringa is often referred to as a panacea and can be used to cure more than 300 diseases. The presence of
                phytochemicals makes it a good medicinal agent.
            </p>
            <p>Studies show Moringa contains a number of compounds with health-promoting effects, including quercetin
                and beta-sitosterol. It also has anti-inflammatory compounds and may protect against health issues
                linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, including heart disease and certain cancers.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, it may help treat and/or prevent several chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high
                cholesterol, arthritis, asthma, and high blood pressure.</p>
